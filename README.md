# DSA-rs - A learning journal
I'm new to rust, and I also want to improve my knowledge on DSA, So I thought why don't I kill two birds with one stone.

The solutions I push here will be problems from sites like leetcode, exercism, codewars and more.

And yes, this is a desperate attempt to keep my contributions up while I learn about Rust and Dsa.
